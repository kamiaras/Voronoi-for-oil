# Chevron-Voronoi Point Placement Tutorial

## Overview

This project provides tools for optimizing spatial placement of points within a polygon using Voronoi‚Äêbased feasibility criteria. You can:
- Generate random convex polygons with interior seed points.
- Compute and plot clipped Voronoi diagrams.
- Solve for the maximum number of additional points meeting area and spacing constraints using various solvers:
  - QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization)
  - GA (Genetic Algorithm)
  - DE (Differential Evolution)
  - SPSA (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation)
